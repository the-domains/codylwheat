### Will there be a Super Bowl 100?
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/816308e3-5082-4c31-98c9-d60d9966832e.jpg)

I need to preface this by saying that I want there to be a Super Bowl 100\. I want the Super Bowl to continue for a long, long time, because I love football. It taught me some of life's most important lessons: discipline, teamwork, how to overcome adversity, and that sometimes life isn't fair.

### **BUT...**

At the same time, I think the next 50 years could be a very challenging time for the NFL. Americans still love football, but preferences change. We can look at what's happening to the MLB as an [example][0] of what could be in store for football if the NFL doesn't address some key issues:

### **Concussions**

The obvious one, right? The NFL is currently trying to address this, but football is a violent game and this problem isn't going away. To be fair, [new helmets][1] are coming that might help reduce the amount of serious brain trauma. But concussions will continue to act as a deterrent for parents who don't want their kids to suffer head trauma, at any age. Most parents understand that any sport carries some risk of injury. But when it comes to damaging your brain, in ways that it can never be repaired, parents and athletes alike are going to start taking pause and reevaluating if there aren't better alternatives for them.

### **Difficult global expansion**

Sports are one of the easiest ways to start a conversation with someone you don't know because they're the same from one culture to another. It's a common measuring stick that we use to evaluate performance and can give us a starting point for getting to know someone. As the world becomes more interconnected, we're going to desire some sport that gives us a cultural common ground with other nations. Right now, the NFL can't provide that.

And the NFL isn't putting in nearly enough energy to become a global product. There are some small football leagues in places like Germany, but the NFL hasn't made any real effort to become a global phenomenon. If they don't start soon, they're going to miss out on becoming part of a global culture.

### **People hate ads**

For now this is a relatively minor issue, but the fact is that people don't like being advertised to. And outside of the Super Bowl, commercials are something people dread when watching TV. The structure of football enables there to be commercial breaks all the time: after a kickoff, after a change of possession, at the end of quarters, for injuries. There's more, but you get the idea. More time for ads means more money for the league. I'm not here to say that the pursuit of money is wrong, but it's starting to come at the detriment of a viewers experience.

The beauty of sports like soccer or rugby is that the nature of the game doesn't allow for many commercials. Both have non-stop play, so most of the ads you're going to see are on the pitch or the players. With these sports consumers don't have to sit through as many ads, and that might really start to matter in the next 10 years, let alone the next 50\.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If there is a Super Bowl 100, I'll be 73 when it takes place. I would love to take on the role of the grouchy old man, sitting in my reclining chair, screaming at the TV, convinced that I can influence the outcome of the game. I want football to continue, and I think it would be amazing for the sport to be played around the world. But a lot of things need to happen for that to become a reality. I believe that if the NFL doesn't start address these issues seriously, and soon, we all risk not having a Super Bowl 100 to celebrate.
